# GroupFinderv2

This is a repository that contains an as of yet work-in-progress rewrite/upgrade to Jeremy Tinker's 2011 halo-based groupfinding algorithm.

Please note that the k-d tree code being used comes from John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org> (https://github.com/jtsiomb/kdtree).

# Setup

Everything you need should be in the src folder. Make sure you have downloaded and set up my C library (https://github.com/malpaslan/libC_main). You'll need to edit paths in the Makeile.

Use make all to compile everything.
