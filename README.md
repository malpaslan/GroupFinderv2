# GroupFinderv2

Bear with me, this is my first time using GitHub.

This is a repository that contains an as of yet work-in-progress rewrite/upgrade to Jeremy Tinker's 2011 halo-based groupfinding algorithm.

Please note that the k-d tree code being used comes from John Tsiombikas <nuclear@member.fsf.org> (https://github.com/jtsiomb/kdtree).

# Setup

Everything you need should be in the src folder. Use make all to compile everything.
